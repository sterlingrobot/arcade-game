Bug Attack
==========

###Classic Arcade Game Clone###
####for Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree####

In this project, I explored writing clean Object-oriented Javascript to recreate a classic
Frogger-like Arcade Game with HTML5 Canvas.  Using [http:/requirejs.org](RequireJS), I
used a module pattern to simplify object dependencies and encapsulate functionality of
the entities.


**The bugs are invading Littletown!**
Can you complete all the levels and get a high score?
Can you add your own level or a new entity?


- Clone the project on your desktop
```javascript
git clone git@github.com:sterlingrobot/arcade-game.git
```
- Install the dependencies
```javascript
npm install
bower install
```

- Open index.html with your favorite local development server
- Follow the instructions onscreen
- Use your keyboard to navigate
- **Most importantly, avoid the bugs!**
- Tip: Water is good in Level 1, but you'll need a raft in the next levels so you don't drown!

###Classic Arcade Game Clone###
for Udacity Front End Web Developer Nanodegree

This project recreates a classic Frogger-like Arcade Game with HTML5 Canvas and Object-oriented Javascript.
[RequireJS](http:/requirejs.org) simplifies object dependencies and encapsulates functionality of
the entities.


**The bugs are invading Littletown!**
Can you complete all the levels and get a high score?
Can you add your own level or a new entity?
